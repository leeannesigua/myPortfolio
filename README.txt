I didn't have a chance to finish this project but I will conitinue to work on it. I was having trouble separating the project boxes and having them fit when the screen shrinks.

I was able to create an About Me, Work, and Contact section. The links in the navagation bar will lead you to designated section when clicked on.
The first project in the Work section is linked to the first homework of the class.
